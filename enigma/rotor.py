	Enigma Rotor class represents a rotor/disk that would've been used in the Enigma Machine

	Wiring:
	Rotors had internal wiring that allowed letters to be "encoded" via pseudo-random electrical wiring
	The wiring is simulated with a List that is "rotated" via .insert() and .pop()

	Offset:
	Rotora were often offset to offer an additional layer of scrambling.  This is accomplished by calling
	.ste(n) where n is the offset (int).

	Ring Setting:
	NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
	This is represented by a negative offset that changed the physical rotor by n
